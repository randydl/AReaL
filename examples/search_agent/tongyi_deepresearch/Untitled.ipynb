      "\n",
      "Starting with CM_OTA: The Vdd is specified as 1.2V to 1.8V, but the user needs 2.3V. Wait, the min_value for Vdd is 1.2V, max is None, but the description says \"Low\" supply voltage. So maybe it's not suitable for 2.3V. The Av is 40-60dB, which meets the 34dB requirement. GBW is 300-1000MHz, but the user needs 1791MHz, so this is too low. PM is 60-80 degrees, which is good. Vos is 4-8mV, which is within the 6mV limit. PSD_Vout is 25-50nV/√Hz, but the user wants <=20, so this is over. PSRR is 40-60dB, which meets 30dB. CMRR is 50-70dB, which meets 54dB. SR is 100-300V/us, which meets 140. Tsettle is 5-20ns, which is good. But GBW is too low, and PSD is over. So CM_OTA is not a good fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, FD_CAS_OTA: Vdd is 1.8V, but user needs 2.3V. The min is 1.8V, max is None. So again, maybe not suitable. Av is 60-80dB, which is good. GBW is 50-300MHz, which is way below 1791. PM is 60-80, good. Vos is 3-8mV, so meets 6mV. PSD is 30-60, which is over 20. PSRR is 60-80, good. CMRR is 60-80, good. SR is 50-100V/us, which is below 140. Tsettle is 10-30ns, which is over 14.

       "  'content': '<think>\\nOkay, let\\'s see. The user is looking for an OTA circuit that meets specific specifications. The key parameters are Vdd of 2.3V, closed-loop gain (Av) >=34dB, GBW >=1791MHz, PM >=71 degrees, Vos <=6mV, PSD_Vout <=20nV/√Hz, PSRR >=30dB, CMRR >=54dB, and SR >=140V/us. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check the available circuits. From the previous tool calls, the relevant OTAs are CM_OTA, FD_CAS_OTA, FT_OTA, and TS_MILLER_OTA. Let\\'s go through each one.\\n\\nStarting with CM_OTA: The Vdd is specified as 1.2V to 1.8V, but the user needs 2.3V. Wait, the min_value for Vdd is 1.2V, max is None, but the description says \"Low\" supply voltage. So maybe it\\'s not suitable for 2.3V. The Av is 40-60dB, which meets the 34dB requirement. GBW is 300-1000MHz, but the user needs 1791MHz, so this is too low. PM is 60-80 degrees, which is good. Vos is 4-8mV, which is within the 6mV limit. PSD_Vout is 25-50nV/√Hz, but the user wants <=20, so this is over. PSRR is 40-60dB, which meets 30dB. CMRR is 50-70dB, which meets 54dB. SR is 100-300V/us, which meets 140. Tsettle is 5-20ns, which is good. But GBW is too low, and PSD is over. So CM_OTA is not a good fit.\\n\\nNext, FD_CAS_OTA: Vdd is 1.8V, but user needs 2.3V. The min is 1.8V, max is None. So again, maybe not suitable. Av is 60-80dB, which is good. GBW is 50-300MHz, which is way below 1791. PM is 60-80, good. Vos is 3-8mV, so meets 6mV. PSD is 30-60, which is over 20. PSRR is 60-80, good. CMRR is 60-80, good. SR is 50-100V/us, which is below 140. Tsettle is 10-30ns, which is over 14. So GBW and SR are not meeting. Not a good match.\\n\\nFT_OTA: Vdd is 1.2V, but user needs 2.3V. The min is 1.2V, max None. So again, not matching. Av is 30-40dB, which is just above 34? Wait, the user needs >=34dB. The min is 30, max 40. So 30-40dB. So the minimum is 30, which is below 34. So this might not meet. But maybe the actual value is higher? The description says \"Low\" for Av. So maybe it\\'s not sufficient. GBW is 200-2000MHz. The user needs 1791, so this is within range. PM is 60-80, good. Vos is 5-10mV, which is over 6. So this is a problem. PSD is 15-30, which is under 20. PSRR is 30-40, meets 30. CMRR is 40-60, meets 54? No, the min is 40, so 40-60. The user needs >=54, so 40-60 is not sufficient. SR is 100-200, which meets 140. Tsettle is 5-20ns, good. So Vos and CMRR are issues. But maybe the actual values can be higher? Not sure. It\\'s a possible candidate but not perfect.\\n\\nTS_MILLER_OTA: Vdd is 1.2V, but user needs 2.3V. So again, not matching. Av is 60-80dB, good. GBW is 20-100MHz, which is way below 1791. PM is 45-70, so meets 71? No, the max is 70, which is just below. Vos is 3-8mV, meets 6. PSD is 20-40, which is over 20. PSRR is 60-80, good. CMRR is 60-80, good. SR is 20-50, which is below 140. Tsettle is 20-50ns, over 14. So multiple parameters are not met. \\n\\nWait, but the user said the selected circuit doesn\\'t need to fully satisfy all specs but should be the closest match. So looking for the best possible. \\n\\nLooking at the options, FT_OTA has GBW up to 2000MHz, which is above 1791. But the min is 200, so maybe the actual GBW is higher. If the GBW is 1791, then it\\'s okay. But the min is 200, so the actual value could be higher. Also, the Vos is 5-10mV, which is over 6. But maybe the actual value is 5mV. If that\\'s the case, then it\\'s okay. Similarly, CMRR is 40-60, so if it\\'s 54, then it\\'s okay. But the description says \"Low\" for CMRR, so maybe the min is 40. So if the actual CMRR is 54, it\\'s okay. \\n\\nBut the user\\'s requirements are strict. So which one is the closest? \\n\\nFT_OTA has GBW up to 2000MHz, which is above 1791. If the actual GBW is 1791, then that\\'s good. The Vos is 5-10mV, but the user allows up to 6. So if the actual is 5, it\\'s okay. The CMRR is 40-60, so if it\\'s 54, that\\'s good. The PSRR is 30-40, which meets 30. The SR is 100-200, which meets 140. Tsettle is 5-20ns, which is good. The PSD is 15-30, which is under 20. So if the actual values are at the higher end, then FT_OTA could be a good fit. \\n\\nBut the Vdd is 1.2V, but the user needs 2.3V. The Vdd for FT_OTA is min 1.2V, max None. So maybe it can operate at 2.3V? The description says \"Low\" supply voltage, but maybe the actual circuit can handle higher. If that\\'s the case, then FT_OTA is a possible candidate. \\n\\nAlternatively, none of the circuits meet all the specs, but FT_OTA is the closest. \\n\\nSo the answer is FT_OTA.\\n</think>\\n\\n<answer>FT_OTA</answer>'}]"
